# ToDo-App
My very first project using JavaScript. Made by me to use and try out new things that i've learnt during first JS courses.

As in every to-do apps you can ofcourse add and delete tasks. In addition there is a little calendar for the next week so you can plan
your tasks, you can also add certain informations about your todo's, e.g. deadline, priority, and sort them.

**Technology used:**
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
